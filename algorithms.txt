Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value. 
This is usually represented by a shorter, fixed-length value or key that represents and makes it easier to find or employ the original string. 
The most popular use for hashing is the implementation of hash tables.
Hashing algorithms are just as abundant as encryption algorithms, but there are a few that are used more often than others.
Some common hashing algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, NTLM, and LANMAN. MD5: This is the fifth version of the Message Digest algorithm. MD5 creates 128-bit outputs.
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items.
Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.
